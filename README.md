Description: Payroll Calculator
An application that can print and calculate total payroll and estimated pay based on inputted values such as estimated tax (a tool to estimate this value is also included)
and hourly pay. The application will prompt the user to first confirm if they would like to calculate their tax, if yes then it will walk through calculating estimated tax.
If no, then it will procede to ask for the estimated tax percentage as well as the hourly pay and amount of hours worked for the first period. The application will then
continue to prompt the user for amount of hours worked for every period they confirm to calculate. Once all the periods have been confirmed then it will ask the user if 
they would like to print the results of the calculations (all of the results are also printed in the console as the values are entered into the program). If so, then
the application will print the results to a separate txt file known as income.txt. Once completed, the program will end automatically.
